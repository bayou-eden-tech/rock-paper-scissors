# rock-paper-scissors
First js project. Build game from scratch.

This project really tied my brain in knots for a while. I couldn't understand which
inputs to give my for loop, given that I needed the game to stop upon EITHER the
computer or user reaching a score of 5. In my searches, I realized that I could use 
a while loop instead and easily fed it the conditions.

This was fun and definitely stretched my problem solving skills!
